## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for Physical AI Book Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). Created 60 tasks organized across 8 phases: Setup (T001-T005), Foundational (T006-T011), US1 ROS 2 Nodes (T012-T021), US3 URDF Model (T022-T028), US2 Python Agent Integration (T029-T036), US4 End-to-End Pipeline (T037-T043), RAG System Integration (T044-T050), and Polish (T051-T060). Tasks follow proper checklist format with IDs, story labels, and file paths. User stories prioritized as P1, P1, P2, P1 respectively. Identified parallel execution opportunities and dependencies. Each user story is independently testable with clear success criteria.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created for ROS2 module implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation using the task list
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are well-structured and follow the required format for execution

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): begin implementation with Phase 1 setup tasks
